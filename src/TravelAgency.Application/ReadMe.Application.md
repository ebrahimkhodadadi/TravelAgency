# Application Layer :computer:

In this layer we define: 

- CQRS abstraction and implementation
- CQRS validation
- pagination
- responses (sometimes called "DTOs" or "Dtos")
- mappings (do not use AutoMapper, use custom made mappers instead!)
- middlewares and pipelines (that are not EF Core specific)
